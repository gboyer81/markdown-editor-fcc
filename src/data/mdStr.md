# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer

## This is a sub-heading

### And here's some other cool stuff

Heres some code, `<div></div>`, between 2 backticks.

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and
> Block Quotes!

```js
function myFunc() {
  console.log('hello world!');
}
```

You can also do things like this:

- This is a list
- With bullet points
  - And sub points

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
    - With different indentation levels.
      - That look like this.

1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
